# TEMPO Data Pipeline Status Report
## October 5, 2025

## Executive Summary

**STATUS: ❌ NO REAL NASA TEMPO DATA CURRENTLY AVAILABLE**

The API is not serving real NASA TEMPO data because:
1. The database is **completely empty** (0 rows)
2. The Cloud Run pipeline job keeps getting **killed due to memory limits**
3. No data is being committed to the database before the job is terminated

---

## Test Results

### Database Connection Test
```
✓ Database connection successful
✓ Table 'tempo_aqi' exists
✗ Total rows: 0 (NO DATA STORED)
```

### Pipeline Execution Status
- **Current Status**: Jobs repeatedly fail due to Out of Memory (OOM) errors
- **Exit Code**: 137 (OOM kill signal)
- **Memory Limit**: 4Gi
- **Data Processing**: Successfully processes ~1.4-2.2 million out of 7+ million data points
- **Failure Point**: Job is killed before database commit can occur

---

## Root Cause Analysis

### Why We're Seeing "Dummy Data" (Actually No Data)

1. **Empty Database**: The `tempo_aqi` table has zero rows
   ```sql
   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM tempo_aqi;
   -- Result: 0
   ```

2. **Memory Constraint**: 
   - TEMPO dataset has 7,011,722 data points
   - Processing uses ~4Gi+ memory for the full dataset
   - Cloud Run job has 4Gi limit
   - Job is killed at ~1.4M-2.2M points (20-31% complete)

3. **No Partial Storage**: 
   - Data is only committed to database AFTER all processing completes
   - When job is killed, nothing is stored (no partial commits)

### Why Previous Tests Showed "Real Data"

Earlier API tests appeared to work because:
- They were hitting cached responses in Redis
- Or showing data from previous successful (smaller) test runs
- The cache has since expired and database is now empty

---

## Code Changes Made

### 1. Removed Dummy Data Fallback

**File**: `endpoint.py`

**Before**:
```python
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Database connection failed: {e}")
    # Return mock data for demo purposes
    return jsonify({
        "message": "Database connection failed, showing mock data for demonstration",
    })
```

**After**:
```python
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Database connection failed: {e}")
    return jsonify({"error": f"Database connection failed: {str(e)}"}), 500
```

Now the API will properly report errors instead of hiding them with dummy data.

### 2. Created Test Script

**File**: `test_tempo_data.py`

A comprehensive test script that:
- Verifies database connectivity
- Checks for actual TEMPO data
- Validates data authenticity (not dummy values)
- Shows data statistics
- Reports clear success/failure status

**Usage**:
```bash
python3 test_tempo_data.py
```

---

## Solutions to Get Real TEMPO Data

### Option 1: Increase Memory Limit (RECOMMENDED)
```bash
# Update the Cloud Run job with more memory
gcloud run jobs update tempo-pipeline-job \
  --region=us-central1 \
  --memory=8Gi  # or 12Gi
```

**Pros**: 
- Simple fix
- Should allow full dataset processing
- No code changes needed

**Cons**:
- Higher cost
- May still hit limits with larger datasets

### Option 2: Implement Progressive Storage

Modify `main.py` to commit data in chunks:

```python
def extract_data_points(key_data, aqi_grid, chunk_size=5000):
    """Modified to commit data progressively"""
    conn = get_db_connection()
    cursor = conn.cursor()
    
    # Create table first
    cursor.execute("""CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS...""")
    
    for chunk_start in range(0, total_points, chunk_size):
        chunk_data = process_chunk(...)
        
        # Commit each chunk immediately
        cursor.execute("INSERT INTO tempo_aqi...", chunk_data)
        conn.commit()
        
        print(f"Committed chunk {chunk_start//chunk_size}")
```

**Pros**:
- Data is preserved even if job is killed
- Can process any size dataset
- Lower memory footprint

**Cons**:
- Code refactoring required
- Multiple database transactions
- More complex error handling

### Option 3: Use Sample/Regional Data

Process only a subset of the TEMPO data:

```python
# In main.py, filter to specific region
def download_tempo_data(date_str):
    # Add bounding box for North America only
    bbox = {
        'west': -125.0,  # West coast
        'east': -65.0,   # East coast
        'south': 24.0,   # Southern US
        'north': 50.0    # Canadian border
    }
```

**Pros**:
- Fits in memory limits
- Faster processing
- Good for US-focused application

**Cons**:
- No global coverage
- Requires filtering logic

---

## Immediate Next Steps

### To Get Data ASAP

1. **Increase memory to 8Gi**:
   ```bash
   gcloud run jobs update tempo-pipeline-job \
     --region=us-central1 \
     --memory=8Gi
   ```

2. **Run the pipeline again**:
   ```bash
   gcloud run jobs execute tempo-pipeline-job --region=us-central1
   ```

3. **Monitor progress**:
   ```bash
   # Watch logs
   gcloud logging tail "resource.type=cloud_run_job"
   ```

4. **Test for data**:
   ```bash
   python3 test_tempo_data.py
   ```

### To Verify Real Data

Once the pipeline completes:

1. Run the test script:
   ```bash
   python3 test_tempo_data.py
   ```

2. Check the API:
   ```bash
   curl "https://tempo-api-336045066613.us-central1.run.app/latest-aqi"
   ```

3. Look for these indicators of real data:
   - ✓ NO2 concentration varies (not constant 50.0)
   - ✓ AQI values vary (not constant 42.0)
   - ✓ Actual timestamp from TEMPO satellite
   - ✓ Geographic coverage across multiple locations

---

## Current API Behavior

With dummy data removed, the API now returns:

**No location specified**:
```json
{
  "error": "No data available"
}
```

**Database connection failed**:
```json
{
  "error": "Database connection failed: <error details>"
}
```

**With real data** (once pipeline succeeds):
```json
{
  "aqi": <actual value>,
  "category": "<actual category>",
  "latitude": <actual lat>,
  "longitude": <actual lon>,
  "no2_concentration": <actual value>,
  "timestamp": "<actual TEMPO timestamp>",
  "location": "<actual location>"
}
```

## Files Modified

1. `endpoint.py` - Removed dummy data fallback
2. `test_tempo_data.py` - Created comprehensive test script

## Files That Need Updating

1. `cloudbuild.yaml` - Update memory limit to 8Gi or 12Gi
2. `main.py` - (Optional) Implement progressive storage

---

## Conclusion

**Current Status**: The codebase is **clean of dummy data**, but the **database is empty** because the pipeline cannot complete within memory limits.

**Action Required**: Increase Cloud Run job memory to 8Gi to allow full TEMPO dataset processing and storage.

**After Memory Increase**: Run the pipeline and verify with `test_tempo_data.py` to confirm real NASA TEMPO data is being stored and served.
